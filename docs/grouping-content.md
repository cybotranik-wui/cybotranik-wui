# Grouping content

Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening `<body>` and closing `</body>` tags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.

## `<p>`

```HTML

```

## `<adress>`

The HTML `<address>` element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.

```HTML
<article is="section-content">
    <header is="article-header">
        <h3>Example</h3>
    </header>
    <div is="article-app">
        <address is="web-address">
